# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Steps Already Completed

1. Initialized a git repository in the Luscious_Model directory
2. Added all files to the repository
3. Made an initial commit with all files
4. Added the remote GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/KTXJohnson/Luscious_Model.git
5. Updated the README.md with repository structure and GitHub setup instructions
6. Committed the updated README.md

## Steps to Complete

To complete the setup and push the repository to GitHub:

1. Go to GitHub (https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "Luscious_Model" as the repository name
4. Add a description (optional), such as "Lucious Toroidal Model for Chatbot Training"
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files locally)
7. Click "Create repository"
8. After creating the repository, run the following command to push your local repository:

```
git push -u origin master
```

This will push all your local commits to the GitHub repository.

## Verifying the Push

After pushing, you can verify that everything was pushed correctly by visiting:

You should see all your files and directories in the GitHub repository.
